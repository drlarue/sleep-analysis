# Analysis of Sleep Tracking Data

In this Jupyter notebook, I've analyzed sleep data from [Sleep as Android](http://sleep.urbandroid.org/), one of the most popular sleep tracking apps.

The app can back-up the data to Google Drive or Dropbox as a csv file, where each sleep record is saved onto 2 or 3 lines (see [here](http://sleep.urbandroid.org/documentation/developer-api/csv/) for the CSV file documentation).

Note: I manually inserted a row of headers before loading it into my notebook.

Browse through the notebook to see a summary of my analysis as well as all of the code and plots. 
Here is an example of the many plots that are in the notebook:
